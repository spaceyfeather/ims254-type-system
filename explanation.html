        <h3>Formal</h3>

            Headline/Subhead: Roboto Condensed
            <br>Intro/Body: Andada Pro
            <br>Quote: Caveat
            <br>I first chose the body text to be a sans-serif so that it was easier to read, while also having it look
            a bit more modern. The quote text is the least obtrusive script font I could find that still has that
            handwritten look. I went through a number of fonts for the header but ended up with the one that looked the
            most "official." Still looking for a better header font, though.
            <br>This system is meant to be simple and unobtrusive. Personally, there is enough contrast to the sections,
            without one completely overpowering the other. It makes it easier to focus.

        <p>
            Headline/Subhead: Bebas Neue
            <br>Intro/Body: Roboto Slab
            <br>Quote: Nothing You Could Do
            <br>This accidentally ended up being pretty much the... exact same. Oops. The headers are more condensed and
            the quote is a bit fancier.
