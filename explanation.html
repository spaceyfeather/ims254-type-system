            <br>Quote: Nothing You Could Do
            <br>This system is meant to be simple and unobtrusive but with enough contrast to be readable. The
            intro/body text is a simple serif that looks modern while still being easier to read than normal sans-serif
            fonts. The headline is all caps while the subhead isn't to help add contrast between them. In the CSS the
            font weights are different (900 vs 700), but unfortunately there is no higher weight available. The quote
            text is a cursive script to look handwritten and stand out against the intro/body text.
